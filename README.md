# Petri Bench

Collection of tools for quickly generating, analyzing, and exporting petri nets for process analysis.

## üìã Features

### Petri Net Simulator
- Load and visualize Petri net models (PNML format)
- Interactive simulation with step-by-step execution
- Real-time token visualization
- Simulation analysis and metrics
- Export simulation results as XES event logs

### Conformance Checker
- Upload Petri net models and event logs
- Automated conformance analysis
- Fitness score calculation
- Deviation detection and highlighting
- Event log statistics and insights

## üì• Event Log Formats (XES and CSV)

The Event Log uploader accepts both XES (.xes) and CSV (.csv) files.

### Supported CSV schema

- Encoding: UTF-8
- Delimiter: comma
- Header row: required
- Required columns (case-sensitive):
  - case_id: Identifier of the trace/case
  - activity: Activity name (maps to concept:name)
  - timestamp: Event timestamp in ISO 8601 (e.g., 2024-01-01T10:00:00Z)
- Optional columns:
  - lifecycle: Lifecycle transition (e.g., start, complete)
  - resource: Performer/owner
  - Any additional columns are accepted but may be ignored in analysis
- Row ordering: Events within the same case should be ordered by timestamp (ascending)

Example CSV:

case_id,activity,timestamp,lifecycle,resource
trace_1,TaskA,2024-01-01T10:00:00Z,start,alice
trace_1,TaskA,2024-01-01T10:05:00Z,complete,alice
trace_1,TaskB,2024-01-01T11:00:00Z,complete,bob
trace_2,TaskA,2024-01-02T09:30:00Z,complete,carol

Notes:
- Timestamps should include timezone (Z or offset). If missing, UTC is assumed.
- The UI currently stores the uploaded event log content (XES/CSV) for analysis; more advanced parsing may be added.
