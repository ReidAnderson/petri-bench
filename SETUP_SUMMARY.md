# Project Setup Summary

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 🏗️ Modern Development Stack Setup
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** for ultra-fast development server and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom design system
- **React Router DOM** for client-side routing between pages

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure
- **Vitest** for unit testing with React Testing Library integration
- **Playwright** for end-to-end testing across multiple browsers
- **Test coverage** reporting with V8 coverage provider
- Separate test configurations for unit and E2E tests

### 📦 Development Tools & Quality Assurance
- **ESLint** with TypeScript rules and React hooks validation
- **Prettier** for consistent code formatting
- **TypeScript** with strict configuration and path mapping
- **VS Code** settings for optimal development experience

### 🎨 UI Components & Architecture
- Modular component structure with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Header navigation with active state management
- Page-based routing (Simulator and Conformance Checker)
- File upload components with drag-and-drop support
- Chart visualization components (ready for Chart.js integration)

### 📋 Feature Implementation
- **Simulator Page**: Controls for loading, modifying, and running simulations
- **Conformance Page**: File upload for PNML and XES files with analysis tools
- **Visualization**: SVG-based Petri net rendering with interactive elements
- **Results Display**: Statistical analysis and chart components

### 🛠️ Build & Development Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Production build with TypeScript compilation
- `npm run test` - Unit tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:e2e` - End-to-end tests with Playwright
- `npm run lint` - Code quality checks
- `npm run format` - Code formatting

### 🔧 Configuration Files
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration with path aliases
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript strict configuration
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS customization
- `playwright.config.ts` - E2E testing setup
- `.eslintrc.cjs` - Code quality rules
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting rules

## 🚀 Ready for Development

The project is now fully set up with:
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Unit tests passing
- ✅ End-to-end tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Code quality tools configured
- ✅ Modern development workflow established

## 🎯 Next Steps

You can now:
1. **Start developing**: Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. **Add features**: Extend components in the `src/components/` directory
3. **Write tests**: Add unit tests alongside components, E2E tests in `tests/`
4. **Integrate APIs**: Add real Petri net processing logic
5. **Deploy**: Build with `npm run build` for production deployment

The foundation is solid and follows modern React/TypeScript best practices!
